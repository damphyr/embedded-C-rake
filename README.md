# Building embedded systems with rake

This repository contains notes, examples and documentation in support of a series of blog posts on building embedded software using C as the programming language and rake as the build tool.

Together with the blog posts it should form the definitive HOWTO for [Gaudi](http://github.com/damphyr/gaudi) usage.
